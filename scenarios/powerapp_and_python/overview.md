# Lab context

## Exercise 1: Getting Started with Azure OpenAI 
 

## Exercise 2: Introduction to Prompt Engineering & Azure OpenAI Studio 

In this exercise, you will insights into prompt engineering for language models, particularly with a focus on Azure OpenAI Studio's Playground. The labs cover the fundamentals of prompts, their elements, and the emerging discipline of prompt engineering. By providing hands-on examples and scenarios, participants learn to refine prompts to achieve desired outputs from language models. The objective is to impart skills in effectively instructing models, optimizing for specific tasks, and understanding the nuances of generating contextually relevant responses. Through experimentation and iterative learning, participants develop proficiency in leveraging language models for diverse business applications.

## Exercise 3: Build Open AI application with the Power App

This scenario allows use cases to use Open AI from Power App applications via OpenAI Python SDK.

Integrate the capabilities of Azure OpenAI into their Power Apps. The specific use case or task that the Power App accomplishes will depend on the design and functionality of the imported Power App and associated Power Automate Flow. The integration with Azure OpenAI suggests that the Power App may involve natural language processing or other AI-related tasks powered by OpenAI services.

The integration of OpenAI with Power Apps enables users to seamlessly enhance their applications with advanced language processing and natural language understanding, unlocking the potential for more intelligent and responsive solutions within the Power Apps environment.

## Exercise 4: Build Open AI application with Python

This scenario allows use cases to use Open AI from Python applications via OpenAI Python SDK.

Provide a hands-on experience in interacting with the Azure OpenAI Service, experiment with the OpenAI Python SDK, and explore the customization options available through various parameters. Users gain practical insights into how to configure and use the service for their natural language processing tasks, such as generating text based on prompts and adjusting model behaviour through parameters.
